    The complete documentation of vym is available as PDF document in
    english and spanish. (The spanish version is not really up to date,
    translators are welcome). It can be accessed directly from vym via
    the help section It also can be downloaded from the vym site at
    Sourceforge:

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/vym/

* Screencasts

    There are several screencasts available on YouTube, which show some
    feature of vym and how to use them:

The official downloads for all platforms are available at the project
site:

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/vym/

The latest binaries for Linux (currently mainly openSUSE) are found in the
Open Build Service project of Uwe Drechsel (aka insilmaril):

Installation
------------

* Binaries

    Installation depends on the platform you use, please check the
    homepage for details:

	http://www.insilmaril.de/vym

* Compiling

    Compiling vym from scratch is pretty easy, if you have the
    development packages of the Qt5 toolkit installed. (Check also the
    homepage above for details):

    qmake
    make
    make install

* Testing (without installing!)

    You can also run vym virtually in your webbrowser: vym is available
    as appliance in SUSE Studio. SUSE Studio is a very easy way to
    create appliances, which are customized Linux operating systems.

    All you need is to quickly create a free account and search for
    "vym" by user "insilmaril" in the gallery:

	http://susestudio.com

    The appliance can be downloaded as installable iso image, or run in
    the testdrive - in your webbrowser! That's a bit slow, but gives you
    an idea without having to install anything at all on your system.
